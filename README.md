# chatbot-field-study

In July of 2017, the Studio at CMP performed an intensive field study of visitors to three (Carnegie Museum of Art, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Carnegie Science Center) of our four museums. Our goal was to benchmark both museum usage and mobile device usage so we can effectively build something that lives dynamically in these areas. This research, along with focus groups and rigorous testing, will inform design decisions as we develop [an artificially-intelligent chatbot](https://studio.carnegiemuseums.org/introducing-muse-20a6f11c7c35).

This repo includes:

* Our methodology
* Our raw data

We feel interesting insights have emerged from this research and we've posted some key takeaways over on the Studio site.
